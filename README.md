# DC-Load-Balancing-Simulator

This simulator has been built to allow the user to setup and simulate a load balancing system of a data center with an arbitrary number of servers and an arbitrary number of tasks, generated during the simulation.

The software simulates the performances of different load balancing algorithms (Pod-d, JBT-d, JSQ) under different system loads.
